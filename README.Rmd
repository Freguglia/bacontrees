`bacontrees` is an R package that provides tools to create algorithms involving
**Ba**yesian **Con**text **Trees**.
The package uses the `R6` OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) paradigm to define
classes for the main structures involved when constructing Bayesian Context Trees,
making it a highly extensible framework to develop new algorithms within this
field,
as well as define functions that work out of the box for the main methods available.

## Installation

You can install the development version of bacontrees from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Freguglia/bacontrees")
```
