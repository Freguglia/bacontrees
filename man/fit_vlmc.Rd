\title{Fit a Variable Length Markov Chain (VLMC) via Context Algorithm}
\usage{
fit_vlmc(data, cutoff = 10, max_length = 6)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Either a character vector (single sequence) or a list of character vectors (multiple sequences).}

\item{cutoff}{Numeric. Cutoff value for the (log) likelihood ratio test statistic used for pruning.}

\item{max_length}{Integer. Depth of the maximal tree considered.}
}
\value{
A \code{ContextTree} object representing the fitted VLMC as the active tree.
}
\description{
Fits a VLMC model to discrete sequence data using the context algorithm, performing likelihood ratio tests to prune the context tree.
}
\details{
The function builds a maximal context tree, computes log-likelihoods for each node, and prunes nodes whose likelihood ratio test statistic is below the cutoff. The result is a pruned context tree representing the fitted VLMC.
}
\examples{
data(abc_list)
fit <- fit_vlmc(abc_list, cutoff = 20, max_length = 4)
print(fit$getActiveNodes())
