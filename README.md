`bacontrees` is an R package that provides tools to create algorithms
involving **Ba**yesian **Con**text **Trees**. The package uses the `R6`
OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) paradigm to define classes for the
main structures involved when constructing Bayesian Context Trees,
making it a highly extensible framework to develop new algorithms within
this field, as well as define functions that work out of the box for the
main methods available.

## Installation

You can install the development version of bacontrees from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
